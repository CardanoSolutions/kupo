# Contributing

## What can you contribute?

#### 1. Feedback

Contributions in the form of feedback and issue is very much welcome. Might it be a suggestion, a bug report or maybe some questions that you have. It helps improving Kupo in the long run and these are probably the best kind of contributions to start with. See [About Issues/Discussions](#about-issues--discussion) below for guidelines.

Do not hesitate to upvote discussions or comments to show your interest!

#### 2. Donation

Feel like tossing some coins for the project? Become a [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/KtorZ) !

#### 3. Code

Make sure to first read the [user-manual ðŸ“–](https://cardanosolutions.github.io/kupo) if you're willing to hack a bit on Kupo. Then, `make help` should provide a good starting point.

For development, [cabal](https://cabal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) should work _out-of-the-box_<sup>TM</sup> provided
that you have the right system dependencies. That is, you'd need the following:

- `libsodium-dev 1.0.*`
- `libgmp-dev 6.1.*`
- `libssl-dev 1.1.*`
- `libpcre3-dev 2.8.*`
- `libsystemd-dev`
- `zlib1g-dev 1.2.*`
- [bitcoin-core/secp256k1@ac83be33](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/tree/ac83be33d0956faf6b7f61a60ab524ef7d6a473)

You can run tests using:

```console
$ make check

# or similarly

$ cabal test all
```

Some tests are end-to-end and require to have a running (and roughly synchronized) [cardano-node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/) and/or [ogmios](https://github.com/CardanoSolutions/ogmios/) against the testnet. These tests are automatically skipped, unless you set the following environment variables (using [`direnv`](https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html) for that is pretty convenient):

```bash
# For cardano-node
export CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET=/path/to/testnet/cardano-node/node.socket
export CARDANO_NODE_CONFIG=/path/to/testnet/cardano-node/config.json

# For Ogmios
export OGMIOS_HOST=127.0.0.1
export OGMIOS_PORT=1337
```

Coding standards are enforced using tools and configuration defined in the repository. Make sure to configure your editor to pick them up ([stylish-haskell](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/stylish-haskell) and `.editorconfig` in particular).

Pull requests are welcome, but we do recommend to open an discussion to bring any idea and discuss design first!
