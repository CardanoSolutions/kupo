# Contributing

## What can you contribute?

#### 1. Feedback

Contributions in the form of feedback and issue is very much welcome. Might it be a suggestion, a bug report or maybe some questions that you have. It helps improving Kupo in the long run and these are probably the best kind of contributions to start with. See [About Issues/Discussions](#about-issues--discussion) below for guidelines.

Do not hesitate to upvote discussions or comments to show your interest!

#### 2. Donation

Feel like tossing some coins for the project? Become a [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/KtorZ) !

#### 3. Code

Make sure to first read the [user-manual ðŸ“–](https://cardanosolutions.github.io/kupo) if you're willing to hack a bit on Kupo. Then, `make help` should provide a good starting point.

For development, [cabal](https://cabal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) should work _out-of-the-box_<sup>TM</sup> provided that you have the right system dependencies. Refer to [Ogmios' user manual](https://ogmios.dev/getting-started/building/) for setting up those system dependencies, they are the same.

Alternatively, you can spin up a nix shell as follow:

```
nix develop github:CardanoSolutions/devx#ghc96-iog-full --no-write-lock-file --refresh
```

Once you're all set, you can run tests using:

```console
$ make check

# or similarly

$ cabal test all
```

Some tests are end-to-end and require to have a running (and roughly synchronized) [cardano-node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/) and/or [ogmios](https://github.com/CardanoSolutions/ogmios/) against the testnet. These tests are automatically skipped, unless you set the following environment variables (using [`direnv`](https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html) for that is pretty convenient):

```bash
# For cardano-node
export CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET=/path/to/testnet/cardano-node/node.socket
export CARDANO_NODE_CONFIG=/path/to/testnet/cardano-node/config.json

# For Ogmios
export OGMIOS_HOST=127.0.0.1
export OGMIOS_PORT=1337
```

Coding standards are enforced using tools and configuration defined in the repository. Make sure to configure your editor to pick them up ([stylish-haskell](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/stylish-haskell) and `.editorconfig` in particular).

Pull requests are welcome, but we do recommend to open an discussion to bring any idea and discuss design first!
