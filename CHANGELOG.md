### [1.0.0] - 2022-03-27

#### Added

- [ðŸ“Œ #1](https://github.com/CardanoSolutions/kupo/issues/1) - New API endpoint to get application's health, 
  - `GET v1/health` â†’ [ðŸ•®  API Reference](https://cardanosolutions.github.io/kupo/#operation/getHealth)

- [ðŸ“Œ #1](https://github.com/CardanoSolutions/kupo/issues/1) - New command `healthcheck` to perform a health check against a running server. Handy when combined with Docker's HEALTHCHECK feature.
- [ðŸ“Œ #9](https://github.com/CardanoSolutions/kupo/issues/9) - Add `header_hash` to each match, so that data can easily be queried from [Ogmios](https://github.com/CardanoSolutions/ogmios) using the chain-sync protocol (which requires _points_ defined as both slot number and header hashes!).

- [ðŸ“Œ #11](https://github.com/CardanoSolutions/kupo/issues/11) - Support for [Ogmios](https://github.com/CardanoSolutions/ogmios) as an alternative chain-sync provider. This is particularly interesting when used with remote instances. This is activated by providing the relevant command-line options instead of `--node-socket` and `--node-config`:
  - `--ogmios-host`
  - `--ogmios-port`

- [ðŸ“Œ #3](https://github.com/CardanoSolutions/kupo/issues/3) - Support for dynamic management (via HTTP API) of patterns. It is not possible to add, remove and list existing patterns via the HTTP API:
    - `GET v1/patterns` â†’ [ðŸ“– API Reference](https://cardanosolutions.github.io/kupo/#operation/getPatterns)
    - `DELETE v1/patterns/{pattern-fragment}` â†’ [ðŸ“– API Reference](https://cardanosolutions.github.io/kupo/#operation/deletePattern1Ary)
    - `DELETE v1/patterns/{pattern-fragment}/{pattern-fragment}` â†’ [ðŸ“– API Reference](https://cardanosolutions.github.io/kupo/#operation/deletePattern1Ary)
    - `PUT v1/patterns/{pattern-fragment}` â†’ [ðŸ“– API Reference](https://cardanosolutions.github.io/kupo/#operation/putPattern1Ary)
    - `PUT v1/patterns/{pattern-fragment}/{pattern-fragment}` â†’ [ðŸ“– API Reference](https://cardanosolutions.github.io/kupo/#operation/putPattern1Ary)

- [ðŸ“Œ #10](https://github.com/CardanoSolutions/kupo/issues/10) - Allow purging old matches (via HTTP API). This is however only allowed if the provided pattern is strictly non overlapping with an existing (active) pattern.
    - `DELETE v1/matches/{pattern-fragment}` â†’ [ðŸ“– API Reference](https://cardanosolutions.github.io/kupo/#operation/deleteMatch1Ary)
    - `DELETE v1/matches/{pattern-fragment}/{pattern-fragment}` â†’ [ðŸ“– API Reference](https://cardanosolutions.github.io/kupo/#operation/deleteMatch1Ary)

#### Changed

- [ðŸ“Œ #2](https://github.com/CardanoSolutions/kupo/issues/2) - The command-line is now more idempotent, restarting the server with the same options will no longer fail and simply resume syncing.

- [ðŸ“Œ #13](https://github.com/CardanoSolutions/kupo/issues/13) - Kupo no longer ignores Byron blocks internally and will now also synchronizes data from them. 

- [ðŸ“Œ #8](https://github.com/CardanoSolutions/kupo/issues/8) - Protects against restarting with different, non-compatible patterns. In case one restart the server with different patterns that those previously provided, it'll abort and crash. Note however that it's possible to restart the server with an empty patterns set, in which case it uses the previously known ones.

### [1.0.0-beta] - 2022-02-27

#### Added

- Initial (beta) release:
  - Synchronization from chosen point (`--since POINT`)

  - Storage in-memory or on-disk (`--workdir DIR | --in-memory`)

  - Multiple patterns via the command-line (`--match`)

  - Basic API access:
    - `GET v1/matches` â†’ [ðŸ“– API Reference](https://cardanosolutions.github.io/kupo/#operation/getAllMatches)
    - `GET v1/matches/{pattern-fragment}` â†’ [ðŸ“– API Reference](https://cardanosolutions.github.io/kupo/#operation/getMatches1Ary)
    - `GET v1/matches/{pattern-fragment}/{pattern-fragment}` â†’ [ðŸ“– API Reference](https://cardanosolutions.github.io/kupo/#operation/getMatches2Ary)
    - `GET v1/checkoints` â†’ [ðŸ“– API Reference](https://cardanosolutions.github.io/kupo/#operation/getCheckpoints)

  - Multi-level (basic) structured component logging (`--log-level`, `log-level-{component}`)

- Current limitations:
  
  - Byron blocks are ignored;
  - The HTTP server does not support `OPTION` and `HEAD` requests;
  - Lack of proper integration testing;
