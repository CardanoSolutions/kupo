    # Overview

    **Kupo** is a lightweight, configurable, **chain-index** for the Cardano
    blockchain. It synchronizes data from the blockchain according to
    **patterns** matching addresses present in transaction outputs, to build a
    **lookup table** from matches to their associated **output references,
    values and datum hashes.**

    # Installation

    ### From pre-compiled executables

    Pre-compiled static binaries can be downloaded as build artifacts from
    [latest releases](https://github.com/CardanoSolutions/kupo/releases) or the
    continuous [`Nix` Github workflow](https://github.com/CardanoSolutions/kupo/actions).

    ### From Docker

    Kupo is available as a standalone Docker image on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/cardanosolutions/kupo).

    ```console
    $ docker pull cardanosolutions/kupo
    ```

    ### From source

    ```console
    $ nix build -f default.nix kupo.components.exes.kupo
    ```

    This produces a statically-linked executable that provides a command-line
    interface for passing options and commands.

    # Getting Started

    Kupo connects to a _local [cardano-node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/)_
    in order to receive information from the blockchain. It goes without saying
    that an up-and-running cardano-node is required to run kupo!

    A single kupo server is meant to build an index for a specific set of
    addresses. Addresses are matched according to flexible patterns. Once
    matched, results can be queried as JSON via HTTP GET requests.  For
    instance, it is possible to synchronize all addresses associated with a
    given stake key (e.g.  `stake_vkh14hkp0sncfkt76spuqydtww4r900hfmsseezztzlh9sjkkjx6d7q`).

    Provided that the configuration and IPC socket for a cardano-node are
    available in `some-folder/cardano-node`, one can start a kupo server as
    follows:

    ```console
    $ kupo \
      --node-socket some-folder/cardano-node/node.socket \
      --node-config some-folder/cardano-node/config.json \
      --since origin \
      --match "*/stake_vkh14hkp0sncfkt76spuqydtww4r900hfmsseezztzlh9sjkkjx6d7q" \
      --in-memory
    ```

    #### --in-memory / --workdir \<dir>

    This will build an index from the beginning of the blockchain (i.e.`origin`)
    of all transaction outputs where that stake key has been involved in. The
    `--in-memory` option tells kupo to not persist the index on-disk but to
    build it fully in-memory. When building such a large index (from origin!),
    this is not recommended as it may cause the program memory usage to grow
    unbounded.

    Let's fix that:

    ```console
    $ kupo \
      --node-socket some-folder/cardano-node/node.socket \
      --node-config some-folder/cardano-node/config.json \
      --since origin \
      --match "*/stake_vkh14hkp0sncfkt76spuqydtww4r900hfmsseezztzlh9sjkkjx6d7q" \
      --workdir ./db
    ```

    Perfect, now kupo will store all the information in a database on-disk at
    the location pointed by `--workdir`. Incidentally, this also allows kupo to
    resume its work from where it lefts it in case the server is interrupted.
    Neat!

    #### --since \<slot-no.header_hash>

    What if we only need to synchronize from a given point in time? For
    example, we may want to skip the entire Byron and Shelley eras because we
    know that this stake key may only have been used starting from the Allegra
    era onwards.  Fortunately, we can use the `--since` to provide a different
    starting point!

    ```console
    $ kupo \
      --node-socket some-folder/cardano-node/node.socket \
      --node-config some-folder/cardano-node/config.json \
      --since 16588737.4e9bbbb67e3ae262133d94c3da5bffce7b1127fc436e7433b87668dba34c354a \
      --match "*/stake_vkh14hkp0sncfkt76spuqydtww4r900hfmsseezztzlh9sjkkjx6d7q" \
      --workdir ./db
    ```

    Points are given as `{slot_no}.{header_hash}` and defines an exclusive
    boundary. Said differently, kupo will start synchronizing from the next
    block following the given point. In case you need them, see the section
    [#era-boundaries] which references points at which era ends for mainnet and
    testnet; useful to start syncing from a specific era.

    #### --match \<pattern>

    Kupo can accept one or more matching patterns using the `--match` option.
    In case multiple patterns are provided, they'll ALL be used when looking
    for addresses. This allows for example to build an index for a list of
    payment keys known of a wallet. The syntax for patterns is explained in
    greater details in the [Pattern](#section/Pattern) section below.

    #### --prune-utxo

    Sometimes, it isn't necessary to keep old data around. Fear not, Kupo has
    got you covered! Using the `--prune-utxo` command-line flag, you can
    instrument Kupo to automatically remove inputs that are spent on-chain.

    This makes sure to keep only what's truly available on-chain and has a
    positive effect on both the final size of the index and the synchronization
    time. If you don't set that flag, then all data are kept in the database
    and spent inputs are instead marked to know if and when they were spent.

    Note that spent inputs aren't removed immediately but only after _at least_
    12h (or 2160 blocks). This is because data on-chain only becomes truly
    immutable after 2160 blocks (though it is stable with a high probability
    much before that).

    You can then using query-flag in the API to filter results based on whether
    or not they've been spent.

    #### --ogmios-host \<hostname> / --ogmios-port \<port-number>

    So far, we've connected Kupo to a local cardano-node, using a unix domain
    socket as a communication channel. However, Kupo can also connect through
    [Ogmios](https://github.com/CardanoSolutions/ogmios#readme); and this works
    for either a local or remote instance of Ogmios! To do so, simply swap the
    `--node-socket` and `--node-config` options for `--ogmios-host` and
    `--ogmios-port`. For instance:

    ```
    $ kupo \
      --ogmios-host my-ogmios-server.io \
      --ogmios-port 443 \
      --since 16588737.4e9bbbb67e3ae262133d94c3da5bffce7b1127fc436e7433b87668dba34c354a \
      --match "*/stake_vkh14hkp0sncfkt76spuqydtww4r900hfmsseezztzlh9sjkkjx6d7q" \
      --workdir ./db
    ```

    Kupo will synchronize data directly from Ogmios! Neat isn't it?

    #### --help

    In case you're lost, don't forget that a summary of this manual is available by running:

    ```console
    $ kupo --help
    ```

    # Pattern

    Kupo can construct patterns from pretty much every constituant of an
    address, in any kind of format (bech32, base16, base58, you name it!). It
    also accepts wildcards using the asterisk symbol `*`.  Conceptually, patterns
    match the logical structure of (Shelley) addresses which are divided into two
    parts: a payment part and a delegation part. To learn more about Cardano
    addresses, feel free to look [CIP-0019](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0019#readme)
    for a deep dive!

    Here below is summarized the general syntax for valid patterns. Note that
    different patterns may match the same addresses. Note also that while `*`
    will match _any_ Cardano address (Byron included), `*/*` will match only
    Shelley addresses (since Byron addresses do not have any delegation part!).

    - `*/4fc6bb0c93780ad706425d9f7dc1d3c5e3ddbf29ba8486dce904a5fc`
    - `*`
    - `*/*`

    # Accessing Results

    Matches can be queried from the server via HTTP GET requests. For example:

    ```console
    $ curl http://localhost:1442/matches
    ```

    will return all matches currently present in the database (be careful when
    combined with very permissive patterns and wildcards!). The `/matches`
    endpoint actually accept patterns, which may be different from the one
    provided in the command-line. So it for instance possible to build an index
    for all addresses but then, lookup only a single address as:

    ```console
    $ curl http://localhost:1442/matches/addr1vyc29pvl2uyzqt8nwxrcxnf558ffm27u3d9calxn8tdudjgz4xq9p
    ```

    Optionally, you can query only `unspent` or `spent` results using the respective query flags:

    ```console
    $ curl http://localhost:1442/matches/*/*?unspent
    ```

    The complete API reference is available below.

            `--prune-utxo` enabled, the server gets rid of spent UTxOs, but it
            only does so after a certain time. That time is exactly `129600`
            slots (or 36h on Mainnet/Testnet). This is because the core
            protocol cannot roll back further than this particular depth and it
            is the point after which it is 100% safe to remove data from the
            database.

            However, this endpoint allows you to break this invariant and
            rollback to points that are even older in the past. As a
            consequence, while syncing, the index may be in a somewhat
            inconsistent state because some inputs spent at a later time may
            not have been recovered during the rollback. This may be surprising
            if you're expecting to see and query those transient inputs after
            rolling back.

            By default, you won't be allowed to rollback beyond the safe zone.
            If, however, you know what you're doing, you're kindly asked to
            pass `unsafe_allow_beyond_safe_zone` as a token of acknowledgment.
            Passing `within_safe_zone` has no effects other than the default.

            Note that, once synchronized again, the index will always be in the
            expected state and problems reflecting reality only occurs _while
            catching up_, after a long rollback.

      summary: Get Pattern (*)
      description: |
        Retrieve all patterns that include<sup>*</sup> the provided pattern. Remember that an address is itself a pattern!
        This endpoint is thereby useful to check is an address is matched by a given pattern configuration (the returned
        list would be non-empty).

        > <sup><strong>(*) Definition</strong></sup> <br/>
        > If all results matched by `y` are also matched by `x`, then `x` is said to include `y`.

        Removes patterns from the database and active filtering. Note that this does
        **NOT** remove the corresponding matches nor will it halt or restart synchronization.
        The server will continue filtering new blocks but, will that pattern removed.

      description: |
        Retrieve a **sample of** all checkpoints currently in the database, in descending `slot_no` order.
        This is useful to know where the synchronization is at. On restart, the synchronization will continue from the most recent
        checkpoints that is also valid on the network.

      summary: Get Checkpoint By Slot
      description: |
        Retrieve a checkpoint by its (absolute) slot number. The query is flexible by default. Meaning that, if there's no checkpoint at the given slot, the server
        will instead return the point of the closest (i.e. most recent) slot that is **before** the provided slot number. This is particularly useful to find ancestors to known slots
        in order to use them for references on-chain.
